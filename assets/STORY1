/210/The year is 927 A.D. (as mortals
reckon time) and the Almighty Odin
has summoned you, his faithful and
heroic son, to the great Hall of
Asgard:




 /208/"Thor, my son, your evil half-brother
 /209/Loki, The God of Mischief/208/ has once
 again betrayed us. While I slept the
 great Odinsleep, he managed to
 subdue and take control of my beloved
 land of Midgard.

 He has acquired the aid of two of his
 most fearsome allies:

 /209/Jormangund the Midgard Serpent/208/, and

 /209/Nognir, Prince of the Underworld/208/.

 If you are not able to stop him now,
 his control over Midgard will be so
 complete that I, myself, may not be
 able to oppose him and his two very
 powerful accomplices.

 To help you on your mission, I give
 you my most trusted weapon:

     /209/Mjolnir, the Enchanted Hammer/208/

 Made for me by the king of trolls,
 and enchanted by my own power, it
 will always return to the one who
 throws it."

/210/Now, armed with only your enchanted 
hammer and considerable wits, 
you must journey to Midgard and 
destroy Jormangund!


            /209/Hail Asgard!
