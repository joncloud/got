  and most deadly mission. You must
  search out and defeat your evil
  and twisted half-brother, /209/Loki the
  God of Mischief/208/!

  He has established his throne in
  the small town of /209/Blechton/208/, which
  he has even had the nerve to rename
  '/209/Lokisburg/208/'.

  Unknown to /209/Loki/208/, a small group of
  the villagers have banded together
  to form a rebellion. Although they
  are brave souls, they do not stand
  a chance in Hela of removing him
  from power.




  All these people need is a great
  warrior to lead them. You will
  find many of the people there
  willing to help you, but highly
  suspicious of strangers.

  Go to /209/Blechton/208/ and win their
  trust. They will be invaluable
  to your mission.

  It is a very long road that leads
  to their village and it is filled
  with /209/Loki's/208/ minions. But I know
  you can make it, because you are
  my first born son...a true warrior,
  and the mighty...

           /209/GOD OF THUNDER!/208/
