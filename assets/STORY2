  to the town of Milgrund. There you
  will find the information you need
  to locate /209/Nognir, Prince of the
  Underworld/208/.

  He has enslaved the entire town and
  makes all male citizens work in the
  Teflor mines. Any man who will not
  work in the mine is imprisoned.

  Nognir uses Teflor to produce
  smaller versions of himself to
  use as weapons. These weapons are
  very deadly, as you will soon
  discover.





  Even now, word of your courage
  and prowess is quickly spreading
  throughout the land.

  The people of Milgrund are eagerly
  anticipating your arrival. Among
  them you will find many allies.

  But alas, mighty Nognir is also
  expecting you. He has sent all of
  his henchmen and set many traps
  to stop you from reaching him.




  /209/Go now and destroy the evil Nognir!/208/
