# God of Thunder (MS-DOS)

This is a copy of the MS-DOS Game God of Thunder. The intention of this project is to build and compile the game in order to preserve compatibility with its original system requirements.

### Original Source Distribution

This is the source code for the 1994 DOS shareware game God of Thunder (Turbo
C/Assembler).

It is a good example of how not to code in C. I was once told it was impressive
that it actually worked, so that's something.

This is only the main source code here. I have released it to the public
domain. Do whatever you want with it. It will not compile as-is. There is at
least 1 3rd party compression file missing and the sound/music code was a
licensed library that is not open source. The opening/high score/game select
screens are also not included.

The game itself can be found for free on Steam. The graphics of the game are
not open source and may not be used in any commercial projects. The music and
sound effects are public domain but I would appreciate credit to "Roy Davis" if
you use any of the music. He was my father and he passed away in 2011. The
music and other stuff is in GOTstuff.zip.

Sorry, but I cannot offer any support.

#### Features
