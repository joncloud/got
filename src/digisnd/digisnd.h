// [NOTE] These variables are actually word-sized, but the game code treats
// them as byte-sized. Most likely, the code here was using a typedef like
// `bool` which was defined as a byte in the game code, but as a word in the
// implementation of the library.  So it seems that - if the header file Jason
// gave the developers did contain the typedefs - they were deleted by the
// developers, maybe due to conflicting with Duke 2's own type definitions. And
// they forgot to check that their definition of `bool` matched Jason's, hence
// the mismatch.
//
// Now, this doesn't cause any observable problems, but it does result in
// slightly different code generation, which is less efficient in some cases.
//
// Another aspect is that these are declared as `far`, which causes the compiler
// to emit more expensive segment access code when loading these variables, even
// though there is only a single data segment.
//
// None of this is a serious problem, since these variables aren't accessed too
// frequently. It's just interesting to see.
