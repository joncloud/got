/*******************************************************************************

Digital audio playback library by Jason Blochowiak

This library consists of three components:

* Hardware detection and configuration
* 8-bit audio playback on a SoundBlaster (or compatible) card using DMA
* Playback of audio files using the Creative Voice format (.VOC)

The latter is built as a layer on top of the regular audio playback in a pretty
neat way. The audio playback layer supports 8-bit audio, either uncompressed
PCM or various SoundBlaster-specific compression schemes.  Only one sound
effect can play at a time.  It's implemented using the single-cycle DMA mode,
which is available on all models of SoundBlaster cards (including the original
1.0 version from 1989). Later models also feature a so called "auto-init DMA"
mode, which allows for fully seamless continuous audio playback.  That mode
would be more complex to use for the type of audio playback implemented in this
library, however, and would exclude the oldest models of SoundBlaster hardware.
So single-cycle mode is a decent choice here.  Unfortunately, it can lead to
some audible glitches like clicks and pops on later models like SoundBlaster
16.

Like the basicsnd library, a lot of the code here is very similar to code in
Wolfenstein 3D. I kept some of the original names intact, but also modified some
to make the code easier to understand. Any references made to functions when
talking about similarities in the code refer to the Wolfenstein 3D source:

    // 2 enabled if it was already enabled by the time EnableSbInterrupts()

  // The basic idea here is that we program the PC's DMA controller with the
  // address and length of the data we want to play, and then send a command to
  // the Sound Blaster to kick off DMA-based playback. The DMA controller will
  // then transfer the data from main memory to the sound card without any
  // involvement by the CPU. The sound card will start generating audio as soon
  // as it receives data. Once the transfer is complete, we receive an
  // interrupt - that's handled by SBService. Within the interrupt, we can then
  // submit the next piece of data if there's still some samples left to play,
  // or stop if we're done. This process is also known as "single-cycle DMA" in
  // the Sound Blaster documentation.
  //
  // The DMA controller used in the IBM PC only supports transfers of up to
  // 64kB in size. And what's more, the controller chip itself only supports
  // 16-bit addresses, requiring part of the address to be loaded into a
  // separate "Page Register" (a dedicated hardware component specific to the
  // IBM PC). The value in the page register will then be combined with the
  // address coming from the DMA controller to generate the actual address.
  // Finally, addresses within the block to be transferred must not cross a
  // 64kB boundary, since the page register is not automatically incremented as
  // the data is transferred.
  //
  // Because of this, we first need to decompose our pointer into a 16-bit
  // address and a 4-bit offset for the page register.
  lengthToPlay = length;

  // Derive the "data page" from our pointer, this is what we will program into
  // the DMA page register below. The data pointer is a huge pointer, so it
  // consists of a segment and an offset, which can be combined into a 20-bit
  // address. Here, we take the upper 4 bits of the segment value, which is
  // what we need for our page number.
  dataPage = FP_SEG(data) >> 12;

  // Now compute the 16-bit DMA address by combining segment and offset in a

  dataOffset = ((FP_SEG(data) & 0xFFF) << 4) + FP_OFF(data);

  // If the resulting offset is larger than 16 bits, we need to adjust it to
  // fit, by bumping up the page number and subtracting 0x10000 from the
  // offset.  The resulting physical address is still the same, we just move
  // the high bit in the address from the offset value into the page value,
  // basically.
  //

  //
  // [NOTE] In theory, a very large sound effect might cross multiple 64kB
